# 🚀 **OMOP-Anonymization-and-Mapping: Empowering Healthcare Data Privacy and Standardization**

Welcome to **OMOP-Anonymization-and-Mapping**, a comprehensive repository designed to facilitate the anonymization and mapping of synthetic healthcare data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This project is a critical step towards ensuring patient data privacy while enabling robust data analysis and interoperability.

## 🔐 **Anonymization: Ensuring Patient Data Privacy**
Our repository includes scripts that implement advanced techniques to anonymize patient data, ensuring that sensitive information is protected while maintaining the integrity of the dataset.

## 🌐 **Mapping to OMOP Standards: Standardizing Healthcare Terminologies**
We utilize Athena OHDSI to translate dataset fields into standardized terminologies, aligning with the OMOP CDM. This process is essential for achieving consistency and comparability across different datasets.
