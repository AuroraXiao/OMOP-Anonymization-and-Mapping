# OMOP-Anonymization-and-Mapping
**Description:**  
This repository contains scripts and documentation for anonymizing and mapping synthetic healthcare data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The project involves processing a dataset of five patients, including tables on demographics, diagnoses, lab results, medications, and procedures. Tasks include:  

- **Anonymization**: Implementing robust techniques to ensure patient data privacy.  
- **Mapping to OMOP Standards**: Translating dataset fields to standardized terminologies using Athena OHDSI.  
- **Harmonization**: Coordinating data across tables for consistency and Datathon usability.  

This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for turning raw healthcare data into anonymized, standardized, and research-ready formats, enabling future applications in analytics and interoperability.
